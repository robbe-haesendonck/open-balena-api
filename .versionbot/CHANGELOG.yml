      hash: 5ffa8c26a0a402da290507e951172a36dfead95e
      body: |
        This assumes that all clients that can access
        an image, also have access to the application
        it belongs to. The speed gains for device
        authorizations are b/c of how canAccess()
        permissions are applied & how PG is able to
        run the complex application read permission
        on the top level of the query rather than when
        nested 4 into level of `EXISTS (SELECT 1)`.

        It seems that atm it's not needed & on top of

        some time now. Other than that and
        returning just the slug, the
        `normalizeDeviceType` was literally the
        same as `findBySlug`.

      body: |
        The cloud API has a rule which enforces this
        restriction, which means that a PATCH of a device's
        supervisor_version could fail if this code returned
        a release of a different public app that has the same
        release_version.

        We already enforce this in the hook itself, and this rule prevents
        devices that have provisioned with an invalidated hostapp release from
        ever PATCHing/updating after the fact. we ideally only want to enforce
        this rule at upgrade time, rather than always

        This reverts commit db990479be2611f24b6262e12e1dfa092473cea0.

        OpenBalena is not the place to do the config vars change for the private
        device types such as the UniPi Neuron so we revert this commit here.

        This will reduce the load for the common case where active devices are
        not regularly deleted with the potential to briefly respond with a 401
        when a device is first deleted. There may also be a slight delay for
        restored devices to be able to communicate again however again that is
        a very rare case.

      body: |
        This avoids issues where you pin an application to a release for which
        some devices are missing service installs. It also allows simplifying
        the "should track latest release" implementation as it no longer needs
        to care about creating service installs itself

      hash: 9c8ad00d99b239d258dcea7130dba5dee9e60b7b
      body: |
        Currently if the API fails to fetch the device types,
        it would retry infinitely, making the dashboard fail
        to load in BoB if there are no device types in S3, and
        this should resolve that.
